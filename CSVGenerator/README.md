# CSV Geneator

This is a program that files the JSON file created previously and creates a CSV file for each cow. The CSV file format is `tag, time, x, y`. For our purposes, this is all we need. The tag number is necessary later for the visualization. 

## Looking at the code

### Classes

In this program, we use two classes.
*Tag
*TagValue

The Tag class is to handle the data on each tag.
