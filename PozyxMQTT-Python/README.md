# CattleTracker-Pozyx Python

A basic way to connect to the Pozyx system and receive the data. It has it's own interface that we can track the tags in, but if we want to do more on the data it wouldn't work. With this, we can extract that data to do more with it.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

* Python 3
* Pozyx software
* Paho MQTT (We will install this)

### Installation

Download the code from this repository. Then, you must open the command line. Once you are in the command line you must run the following command in order to get Paho MQTT.

`pip install paho-mqtt`

Paho MQTT for Python is now installed.

## Running the Project

Once you have Pozyx running and connected to your device, navigate to the python file. Simply click on main.py and windows will launch the program in the background. When you are finished, simply close the running window.
