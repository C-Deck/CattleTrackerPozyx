# Data Simulation

This is a program that creates movement data and CSV files for a set number of cows. In order to develop the visualization, data is needed to test it. This program creates that data. It creates a fake cow and has it move within a constrained field. As it moves (or doesn't), the program records that and eventually outputs all of that data into a CSV file.
